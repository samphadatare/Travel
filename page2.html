    <div id="m1"> </div>
    <p id="p3" align="justify"> This 42 meter high "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway situated in the heart of Delhi city is much taller in the hearts of India. Formerly known as All India War Memorial, India Gate was built to commemorate the death of 70,000 British Indian soldiers who died during First World War between 1914-21.Even though the India Gate was constructed as a war memorial, the architectural style of the monument makes it appear like an epitome of triumph. Much similar to Arch of Constantine, outside the Colosseum in Rome, India gate was designed by Sir Edward Lutyens.India Gate got an additional structure in the form of a black marble plinth, with a reversed rifle capped by a soldier’s helmet after the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. This structure is situated beneath the memorial archway and is bounded by flames on four eternal sides. This is called Amar Jawan Jyoti. India Gate is counted amongst the most significant war memorials in the country.
<br>
What we all know is that India Gate has an essential place in the Indian history, but what many of us may not know is that the memorial has an important spot in the heart of Delhiites. Whenever there is a moment of distress or an occasion to celebrate, India Gate is the perfect spot for that.People visit the place with families to spend some quality time with each other. Food vendors around the area add to the pleasure of hanging out with family and friends. </p>

It was made on the lines of Shah Jahan's palace in his fortified capital Shahanabad. It was called Red Fort because of its massive closed walls built in red stone.
