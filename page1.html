		<p id="p1" align="justify"> Mumbai, previously known as Bombay is one of the most populous and biggest cities of Maharashtra. Also the biggest metropolis of this state, Mumbai is also popular as the entertainment and financial capital. It is the largest city of India and fondly called as the city of dreams. It is a place filled with dreamers and people who work hard day and night to achieve their dreams. From struggling actors, laboureres, Bollywood stars to gangsters, Mumbai has a lot. A lot that can be written about and talked about! Mumbai is also home to one of the biggest slum area as well as home to the richest and thus it is only fair to describe Mumbai as a city for all. The majorsly spoken language is definitely Hindi , but this city has welcomed people from all faiths and religion warmly. If you want to know and experience diversity, visit Mumbai. This city also has its very own language that is the Bambaiiya Hindi. Known to be a city filled with warm and friendly people, we believe that anything written about Mumbai is never enough.<br><br>

If you are planning to visit Mumbai, trust us when we say it may look intimidating initially, but it is not. In fact it is one of the friendliest cities of India. The extreme energy and the fast paced life of the people here cannot be easily matched. The heart of Mumbai has some of the best and beautiful colonial architecture and if you venture out to the lesser known lanes, you will also come across several distinct bazaars, temples, fancy restaurants and a nightlife that is one of its kinds. Before Mumbai became the city hat it is now, it was a collection of seven islands which was eventually formed to form Bombay. It was given to the British as dowry to Charles II who married Catherine of Braganza. The island city that Mumbai is today is owing to these reclamation and these islands were home to several fishing colonies. The British made Mumbai an important port since it was already had a natural harbor but it rose to its richness during the American Civil War when cotton supplies were completely stopped from America to Britain. India made the most of this situation and it is said that traders earned approximately 80 million pounds which is a lot of money. This made way for Bombay’s very own merchant traders who were rich. As you walk around in the many lanes of South Bombay you will still get to witness the remnants of this city’s glorious past. Cotton factories and many buildings that are dilapidated are still to be seen scattered around many parts of Mumbai, especially South Mumbai. Apart from this, another every interesting par about this city is that in spite of the several unfortunate incidents and acts of terrorism this city has seen, it still moves on and lives with the same love for Mumbai.</p>

    <h2 id="visith"> BEST PLACES TO VISIT IN MUMBAI </h2>
    <p id="p2" align="justify"> Apart from the regular and popular places of interests, there are many hidden treasures in Mumbai that one must visit to experience the true spirit of a city that never sleeps.<br> Top 5 places in Mumbai</p>
    <h3>1. Gateway of India </h3>
    <div id="m1"> </div>
    <p id="p3" align="justify"> The Gateway of India that was built in the 20th century is one of the biggest tourist attractions of Mumbai. The building stands beautifully overlooking the Arabian Sea and the location of this building is what makes it so attractive. It is 85 feet tall and it is one of Mumbai’s most significant landmarks. The construction of the Gateway of India took almost 13 years to finish and it was built in dedication to the first visit done by King George V and also Queen Mary to India. This happened in 1911 and hence if you have never noticed, there is also a line that reads, ‘Erected to commemorate the landing in India of their Imperial Majesties King George V and Queen Mary on the second December MCMXI.’ Right opposite to this attraction stands another beautiful and historical building- the Taj Mahal Hotel. This hotel has existed even before the Gateway of India was erected, 21 years before to be precise. Opposite to this beautiful landmark of Mumbai also stands a statue of Shivaji that has a historical significance. Shivaji was a king who resorted to guerilla warfare so that his Maratha Empire could be established. He wanted to set up his empire in the Sahyadri mountain range so that it stands as a symbol of pride and courage that the empire strongly reflected in those times. The statue of Shivaji was unveiled on Republic day in 1961. The Gateway also has total of five jetties to take you to other places of interest away from Mumbai like the Elephanta caves and also Alibaug. Visit the Gateway of India for the scenic beauty. The views of the sea from this monument are worth watching and truly a sight to behold. The architecture is a mix of both Hindu and Muslim styles. The arch of the monument has been given a Muslim styled architecture and the decorating part has been done using Hindu style. </p>
        
        <h3>2. Marine Drive </h3>
    <div id="m2"> </div>
    <p id="p3" align="justify"> Marine Drive is one of the best places of Mumbai. This place of interest is what defines Mumbai in the best possible way. Popular for being an island city, Marine drive is a long stretch that has been made by the Arabian Sea and it stretches up to 3.5 km. It is also called as the Queen’s Necklace and it is called so, because of the long stretch that lights up at night and looks similar to a pearl necklace. The whole promenade is flanked beautifully with palm trees. The best time to visit Marine drive is at night when there is comparatively lesser crowd and there is a distinct peace you feel at that time. The cool breeze, the flowing waves and the lights all makes the feel of sitting here a beautiful one. There would be hardly anybody disturbing you and your moments of solitude, except for the tea vendors that sell hot cups of tea and even coffee till late night. The Marine drive begins at Nariman point to end at Juhu and Girgaum.
Marine drive has also been featured in several Bollywood movies to represent the city. Mumbai is identified by this beautiful attraction and why not, take a walk here and you will know what we are talking about. This is another spot that offers breathtaking views of sunset.

        <h3>3. Shree Siddhivinayak </h3>
    <div id="m3"> </div>
    <p id="p3" align="justify"> We mentioned of a shrine that is mostly visited by people belonging to Islamic faith an even other faiths. Here us another such shrine that attracts people from all over irrespective of the religion or caste. The Siddhivinayak temple was built in dedication to Ganesha who is one of the most revered Gods of Hindu religions. Ganesha is the son of Shiva and Parvati and is respected and worshipped before the beginning of anything auspicious. This temple is highly significant and thousands of devotees visit Siddhivinayak each day. It is said that offering your prayers at this temple will get all your wishes fulfilled and obstacles removed. The Siddhivinayak temple is said to be 200 years old and it was built in 1801. Initially the temple wasn’t as big as it stands today. The temple was small and had a small, beautiful Ganesha idol that was made purely out of black stole. One of the most distinctive features of this idol is that unlike other Ganesha Idols the trunk of the idol at Sidhivinayak faces the right side. This idol has four hands that hold a lotus, axe, a bowl of modaks and also prayer beads. Over so many years the temple earned more popularity and with growing popularity the structure of the temple also changed. There is a popular story that goes around stating the reason of this temple being so popular. It is said that Bollywood super star Amitabh Bachchan had once met with an unfortunate incident and injured himself during the shooting of Coolie. He had met with a grave accident and his wife Jaya Bachchan visited his temple to pray for his well being. Amitabh Bachchan recovered and since then people started believing this temple and its idol’s powers even more. There are several rules that one needs to follow when visiting the temple. You will have to leave your footwear outside and if you want to offer anything there are many small shops outside the temple that sell garlands, sweets and even coconuts. Inside the temple, you also see a small shop that sells sweets and also beautiful idols of Ganesha. The tradition followed inside the temple by most people is speaking your wishes into the statue of a mouse’s (Also known as Muooshak) ears. Mouse used to be Ganesha’s vehicle and hence it is considered equally important by devotes of Ganesha. You must visit this temple for the tradition that it follows. </p>
